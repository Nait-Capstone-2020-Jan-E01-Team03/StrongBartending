ALL FORMS
1. Force login or hide these pages until user has authenticated
- Can't select User.Identity.Name if nobody is logged in, leaving the CreatedBy and ModifiedBy fields blank
2. Update field Labels to user-friendly names
3. Convert "Type" or "Key" fields to drop down lists like we have done with ContactKey
4. Make the notes box a multi-line textbox
5. Exception Handling - Min Max values, Invalid values
6. Prevent bad data from being entered. Field Lengths assigned to textboxes that match what we have in the database.


LEADS
1. LegacyID is not required. Remove it from the form. This is only used in our data migration to assign a unique value to legacy data.
2. EventDate is a Date parameter, not DateTime. We want to set the Time with Start Time.
3. Would should not be able to set guests to -1
